# Cookie-Clicker-Cheater
Yet another Cookie Clicker cheater

[=== Hey, Orteil here. Cheated cookies taste awful... or do they? ===]

This is a simple javascript that allows you to automatically buy, click, etc... into the game.

You just need to copy its content and paste into the console, and send.

## extra commands

You can start when you want by sending the command
` startAuto(); `

You can stop when you want by sending the command
` stopAuto(); `

You can change the click speed (miliseconds) by changing the value of the variable
` clickSpeed = 5; `

You can change the amount needed of enabled automations to buy a new one by changing the value of the variable
` minimumBuy = 1; `

## extra notes

Why would you want to cheat? idk, I made it to play with javascript

I mean, ` cheating ` is not cool, but cookies are cookies.
